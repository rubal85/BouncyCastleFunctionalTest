This directory contains sample JNDI programs translated from the
Netscape LDAP SDK.  It demonstrates for the LDAP programmer the
equivalent way of doing things in JNDI.

It also contains some sample programs that use controls.

These programs all use the LDAP provider by default. The LDAP
provider conforms to LDAP Version 2 (RFC-1777) and to Version 3
(RFC-2251). It supports simple authentication using cleartext
passwords as well as the CRAM-MD5 and EXTERNAL SASL mechanisms.
See LDAP.txt in the doc/providers directory for more details. 

To set up these examples so that they work in your environment,
you need to modify some fields in the Env.java file.  For example,
you probably need to change Env.MY_SERVICE to point to your LDAP
server and port number, the manager's DN and password (Env.MGR_DN
and Env.MGR_PW), and so on.

After you have made these changes, compile the .java files to
generate corresponding .class files. Use JDK 1.1.2 or above.

To run these examples, make sure that your class path includes the
JNDI classes, the classes for the LDAP provider, and the classes of
these examples.
